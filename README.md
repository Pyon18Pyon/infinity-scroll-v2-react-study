# infinity-scroll-v2-react-study

This project was created in React after the completion of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

During this course, the project was made with vanilla JavaScript so I rewrote the entire app in React.
The vanilla JavaScript version: [infinity-scroll-v1-javascript-study](https://github.com/Pyon18Pyon/infinity-scroll-v1-javascript-study).

## What it does?

This project is to show how to implement infinite scroll functionality.

## Key features

- Customized loading animation with the loading.io website.
- Seamless scroll.
- The images are fetched from the Unsplash Image API.
- When we click an image it will jump to the Unsplash website and see the author or download the photo if we want. 
- Mobile responsive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
